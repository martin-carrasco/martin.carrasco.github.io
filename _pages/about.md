I am a research assistant at the Computational Linguistics and Text Mining Lab (CLTL) at VU Amsterdam.
My current research is focused in exploring extractive summarization techniques by looking at the topological
properties of the embedding space of text. I am also interested in **Topological Deep Learning** and the applications of **Graph Neural Networks**
